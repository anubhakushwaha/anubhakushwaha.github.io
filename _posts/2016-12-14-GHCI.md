Okay so another blog,this time it will be a bit longer than usual but I guess it deserves to be a long one.

Great,so let's dive into this wonderful journey which actually started way back in September when I received the congratulatory e-mail on receiving the Grace Hopper Scholarship. I was highly elated as I always wanted to attend conferences,meet established people and breathe the air my idols do(haha psycho touch :grin:).

Grace Hopper is a social gathering of all the wonderful women out in the IT industry. This celebration is now a 7 year old successful venture. It is produced by the Anita Borg Institute and presented in partnership with ACM India.

It was a three day celebration where each and every moment counted, bringing together several known and unknown faces. The first day was the most exciting one since I didn't know what lied ahead of me. Further while travelling on the South Indian streets exposed me to the diversities of our country. We finally reached the first-day venue which happened to be White Orchid. As soon as we stepped down off our buses we were amazed to find so many women gathered for this event. Multiple registration booths were lined up with women from different regions. This was just a sneak peek of what I was going to discover.

I would tell you one thing which would lure you to attend a conference in near future, we actually get a lot of free stuff :yum: The Grace Hopper Conference literally flooded us with so many goodies, here's a quick look at what we got (just so that these things encourage you to apply next year and grab them).

Moving on,the inauguration was a huge hit as it was planned with a high dose of panel discussions, one to one interactions, introductory speeches by the most eminent people of our industry and how can I forget, the performances by the local dance groups. The speeches were so inspiring that literally everyone was glued to their seats in spite of the mouth-watering dishes being served outside :hamburger:. I personally loved the keynote speaker, Mrs.Vanitha Narayanan who is such an inspiring women(PS:She is a great dose of inspiration in case you guys need some, do google about her).

By this time I was feeling so lucky to be a part of this celebration and I had so many reasons to be happy. From meeting old friends who fortunately were present there to getting clicked alongside my idols. Meeting them in person is a whole next level experience, you feel more encouraged and motivated.

Coming next were the career fair booths, all lined up together only to leave you wondering which one to go first. I don't even remember the exact count of the booths but they all had games/quizzes/hackathons and survey sessions. I grabbed a few goodies from there as well.
</div>
<div>
The air around us was full of positivity and it was good to see people connecting with each other. The ambience of the whole place was thrilling and gave major career goals. From keynotes to street plays the place had it all.

Coming next to the food, just recalling those mouth-watering cuisines makes you want to go back even more. The food pumped all of us from time to time. Not to forget, the red-velvet :cake: became the first love of many. The days passed by in a prick of time with each day bringing new opportunities, new people and more experiences. Back at the hotel, we had a small meet-up where all the scholars, as well as, their mentors came along to know each other. Who knew we would just end up dancing :dancer:
